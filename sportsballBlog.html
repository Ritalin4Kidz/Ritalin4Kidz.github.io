	<br> A Little splash of colour. So as this picture suggests i've updated the art on the players. I've also added a bit of customization, in which you can
	choose what colour your team is before you play in "Free Play" mode. I've also got some other aesthetic changes to show later on. I'll have a new video up
	in a week or so which will showcase a majority of the changes since the first protoype.
	<br>
	<br>Oh yeah, and im also working on a new map, which will incorporate new gameplay elements, so stick around for that.

	<br> Hooray two updates in a day! First thing of note is that i've updated the download link to have (a.o.w) the most updated build of the game
	that possibly exists. Secondly, since the last update i've tweaked the season mode a little, as well as adding in two maps into the map selections (one new,
	one old).

	<br> Welcome to the official Sportsball blog post page. This is my first blog post but there's been already been quite a bit of progress made in the game,
	so i'm going to quickly do a run down of what the game currently has:
	<br>
	<br>-Support for 1-4 players (all must be using controller though)
	<br>-AI players (however a.o.w they are pretty simple)
	<br>-Free Play mode with two choosable maps
	<br>-The begining of a season mode
	<br>-A Replay system for when goals are scored
	<br>-A MVP system
	<br>-Paint splats
	<br>
	<br>So far the game is very basic in it's art and has no sounds. However expect that sometime later this will change. Just probably not for a while.
	a.o.w. The majority of focus for development is in improving both the AI and season modes.
	<br>
	<br>Anyways, i'm not going to make a large post here. I hope that i stick to this game enough to make something great. I'll update the download link
	once i have a build i deem publishable. Until then, the current download link will have a earlier build, which will require two players (both using controllers)
	to play.
