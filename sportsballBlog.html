	<br> Welcome to the official Sportsball blog post page. This is my first blog post but there's been already been quite a bit of progress made in the game,
	so i'm going to quickly do a run down of what the game currently has:
	<br>
	<br>-Support for 1-4 players (all must be using controller though)
	<br>-AI players (however a.o.w they are pretty simple)
	<br>-Free Play mode with two choosable maps
	<br>-The begining of a season mode
	<br>-A Replay system for when goals are scored
	<br>-A MVP system
	<br>-Paint splats
	<br>
	<br>So far the game is very basic in it's art and has no sounds. However expect that sometime later this will change. Just probably not for a while.
	a.o.w. The majority of focus for development is in improving both the AI and season modes.
	<br>
	<br>Anyways, i'm not going to make a large post here. I hope that i stick to this game enough to make something great. I'll update the download link
	once i have a build i deem publishable. Until then, the current download link will have a earlier build, which will require two players (both using controllers)
	to play.
	<br>
	<br>    Love, from Callum
