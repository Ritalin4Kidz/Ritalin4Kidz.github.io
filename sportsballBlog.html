	<br> I call this the "Bee Keeper" boss due to me a mixture of referencing prior ideas in development, and a tiny bit of laziness about changing the scene name.
	<br> The main basis of this boss is that the player hurts the boss by making it throw itself into the lava covering the sides of the level. The idea from this level came
	from some messing around with rigidbodys in the scripts, more with the emphasis on looking cool rather than actually doing something.

	<br> And now, more importantly, i've added the option to have a console running in your games. This allows players to affect the game in real time without having to use the spectator mode. I've only showcased a couple of
	commands here, but when the update hits i'll have the full list out!

	<br> Paintball & Memories Part 1
	</div>
	
	<div id = "smalltext" style = "font-size:20;color:black;text-align: left">
	<br> Okay, so it's been a while since my last blog post, and I'm going to quickly address this before I go into the update. First off, the project has not been abandoned. Just progress has been slowed for a couple of reasons:
	<br> 1. Personal interest died on this project for a little period
	<br> 2. A somewhat busy schedule
	<br> 3. Something that I hope i'll be able to talk about in the upcoming months.

	</div>
	
	<div id = "smalltext" style = "font-size:20;color:black;text-align: left">
	<br> Alright Update Time. Firstly I want to mention that i've created a bit more "Experimental" music. Whilst most of the music is just inside jokes with friends or me using a fidget spinner on a ukulele (Phone Call), there is a legitimate
	reason i had for creating more music files. (Although in hindsight I probably should've used actual music)
	<br> 1. Some of the music files are added in to the game's official soundtrack
	<br> 2. In the new Settings menu, the menu's music volume can now be changed
	<br> 3. You can now add custom songs into the game.
	<br> To add a song into the game, you must do as follows:
	<br> 1. Go into your "SportsballSaves" folder, which will most likely be in your documents
	<br> 2. Create a .txt file called "AddedSongs"
	<br> 3. Write a line with this format "url;song-name;song-artist;song-details"
	<br> e.g. C:\\Users\\Callum\\Desktop\\Sportsball 2 Electric Boogaloo\\Sportsball 2 Electric Boogaloo\\05 The Ballad Of Jackson Cheyne.wav;The Ballad Of Jackson Cheyne;Ritalin4Kidz;2018, Sportsball 2 Electric Boogaloo
	<br> 4. Files should be in .wav format

	<div id = "smalltext" style = "font-size:20;color:black;text-align: left">
	<br> New Maps + Paintball Mode Update:
	<br> 3 New Maps (Ruskville Paintball, Sector 12b, Mountain City Park (CTF))
	<br> Paintball mode has been updated as well, so that instead of just being a simple deathmatch, there is now an objective that can make the rounds play out much differently. A bomb can be picked up and planted in the plantzones, which will give the other team a set
	amount of time to defuse it. If the bomb gets defused, the defusing team wins. If the bomb "explodes", the planting side wins the round.
	<br>
	<br> There's still a lot more to cover in this update, Including more ways to modify your game outside of playing. I'll cover all these in the next blog post, which hopefully I put out soon. Until then, here's a quick run-down of what else is in this update:
	<br> -Saving
	<br> -Keyboard Controls
	<br> -New Player Types
	<br> -End Of Game Stats Screen
	<br> -Player Profiles
	<br> -Changable Look Sensitivity
	<br> -Game Mutators (Low gravity, etc.)
	<br> -Probably some other stuff im forgetting.
	<br> Happy Exploring for now! Love, Callum

	<br> The spectator update is finally here! I've been working on this feature for the past two months on & off and I'm so happy to finally be releasing it alongside this new update (Alpha_050).
	So I've got a lot to go through in this post, and i'm probably going to miss some things, so hopefully I cover all the most important parts.

	<br> So first thing i'll cover is just a quick music update. So if you bothered to go through that 3 mins of musical shitposting, you'll probably realise that i've added some more music into the game.
	The more major in the music updates however, is the pop-up that now appears when a new song starts.

	<br> Next up is the new ready up screen. Once players have selected the map, they are then moved to the this new screen, in which the players can choose:
	<br> - What team they're on (although if more than 2 on one team, it will auto balance)
	<br> - Their team's material
	<br> - Their player class
	<br> Everything else in the ready screen has remained the same.

	<br> 4 New Maps! (2 for Caulbury). So before I go into a bit of detail for these new maps, I'm just gonna talk about the direction of this game past & future. Back when i started this project at around
	the begining of march, there was only three maps, all of them being the soccer mode. The biggest difference in any of the maps was that "West Townie Oval' had boundaries. It was teased a little in the previous update
	with 'Magpie Stadium', which had two different maps. One for Euro Sportsball & one for Aussie Sportsball. Since adding in 'Dam City Dam', I haven't made a map that incorporated the original sportsball mode. Honestly, I'm
	not sure if i'll make another original sportsball map at this point. Despite being 50 alpha builds deep into this project, I'm still unsure about what direction I want to move in, or even what the best mode to work on is.
	So to wrap this up, in updates from now on, you're going to see a lot more modes for sportsball, and probably see older modes get neglected a lot. Anyways:

	<br> <img src="AirHockey.PNG" alt="AirHockey" style="width:480px;height:270px;">
	</div>
	
	<div id = "smalltext" style = "font-size:20;color:black;text-align: left">
	<br> Air Hockey:
	<br> This a simple new map/mode similar to the original soccer based mode. The biggest difference however is that the ball is now a puck, and there's a wall in the middle that only the puck can get through. It's a pretty
	simple map, but I'm hoping it plays well enough to be fun.
	</div>
	
	<div id = "smalltext" style = "font-size:20;color:black;text-align: center">

	<div id = "smalltext" style = "font-size:20;color:black;text-align: left">
	<br> Ruskville:
	<br> Ruskville is a new addition to the Euro Sportsball map pool. It's layout is incredibly similar to Magpie Stadium, execpt the trees have been removed. The map is intentionally empty on the actual playing field 
	so that this map can act as the vanilla Euro Sportsball map.
	</div>
	
	<div id = "smalltext" style = "font-size:20;color:black;text-align: center">
	<br> <img src="Caulbury.PNG" alt="AirHockey" style="width:480px;height:270px;">
	</div>
	
	<div id = "smalltext" style = "font-size:20;color:black;text-align: left">
	<br> Caulbury:
	<br> Caulbury is the first map with a weather effect. Everytime this map is played, rain will spawn. Rain has no physical effect on the players or ball. What does however, are the mines scattered on the ground.
	The mines act as a launchpad once collided with, and disappear for 5 seconds after use. Now in the picture you will notice there is a lot of clutter in the map, however this is not in the Euro Sportsball mode of the map.
	<br> Paintball Mode:
	<br> Caulbury has a paintball mode version as well. Paintball mode is the newest game mode in Sportsball, being the first mode to not utilize a ball or puck. Currently paintball mode is pretty simple:
	<br> - Certain amount of players per side
	<br> - Each round has a certain amount of time
	<br> - Once a player is shot, they're out for the round
	<br> - If a team has no players left, the other team wins the round.
	<br> - If time runs out, the team with the most players left wins.
	<br> - If same amount of players, round is tied & replayed
	<br> - First to 8 rounds, or 7-7.
	<br> This mode is still being worked on, so you'll notice some things iffy at the moment, however it is in a state where the game can be won.

	</div>
	
	<div id = "smalltext" style = "font-size:20;color:black;text-align: left">
	<br> Continuing the trend of new modes. A MASSIVE new mode has been added in the form of the Tournament/Story mode. Playable with 1 or 2 players, the Tournament mode follows you on a path to become the greatest
	Sportsball player of all time. You progress in this mode by winning each game & moving onto the next.

	<br> Last but not least, the spectator mode. Selectable in the game options mode, the spectator mode is a mode I built for recording purposes. The window is set up on the second screen, so it is recommended to have two
	monitors to run this mode.
	<br> Honestly there is way too much going on in this mode alone to write, so I've put all the information in a Pdf, which you can access below.

	<br> - Two new maps, Dam City Dam & Magpie Stadium (Two Different Versions, Both A Different Mode Of Sportsball)
	<br> - Euro Sportsball, 4 Points when you touchdown the ball in the opposition endzone and 1 point when through the opposition goals
	<br> - Aus Sportsball, 1 point on left and right goals and 6 for the middle goals
	<br> - On resume of play, game no longer instantly jumps in
	<br> - More options in free play, such as game length, time of day & if extra time will be played
	<br> - improved main menu
	<br> - Character classes, (Regular, Gunner, Scout, Painter, Psychic), all which come with a different special move and stats to play around with.

	<br> Training/Mission mode are quite similar. With the main difference being that you can fail in mission mode. Selecting a map works the same way that Free Play does, and the premise of these

	<br> The last big change to talk about is the new main menu screen. This new screen removes the boring bland yellow background and adds footage of Ai shooting a sportsball
	repeatedly & infinitely. There's also now scrolling news text at the bottom, which will be used to annouce updates and such.

	<div id = "smalltext" style = "font-size:20;color:black;text-align: left">
	<br> There's also a lot more smaller art updates that you'll notice whilst playing. The next thing that i want to talk about is the new map "Sector 14a".

	<div id = "smalltext" style = "font-size:20;color:black;text-align: center">

	<div id = "smalltext" style = "font-size:20;color:black;text-align: left">
	<br> "Sector 14a" is a small inclosed map which hopefully shakes up the gameplay enough to become interesting. Firstly you'll notice that the goals are higher up then usual.
	This will hopefully encourage use of the maps main feature, "Launchpads". Yep, launchpads, step on one of these beautys and you'll be sent flying upwards, which you can use to
	access higher places.
	<br>
	<br>Lastly, i've added map intros the game, so that when you load up a map you're not instantly thrown into the game.

	<br>That's it for now, i'll try to get a video up soon, which will show the changes from the first public build i had available. Until then, happy playing, and have fun checking
	out all the new art in the game.

	<br>So as this picture suggests i've updated the art on the players. I've also added a bit of customization, in which you can
	choose what colour your team is before you play in "Free Play" mode. I've also got some other aesthetic changes to show later on. I'll have a new video up
	in a week or so which will showcase a majority of the changes since the first protoype.
	<br>
	<br>Oh yeah, and im also working on a new map, which will incorporate new gameplay elements, so stick around for that.

	<br> Hooray two updates in a day! First thing of note is that i've updated the download link to have (a.o.w) the most updated build of the game
	that possibly exists. Secondly, since the last update i've tweaked the season mode a little, as well as adding in two maps into the map selections (one new,
	one old).

	<br> Welcome to the official Sportsball blog post page. This is my first blog post but there's been already been quite a bit of progress made in the game,
	so i'm going to quickly do a run down of what the game currently has:
	<br>
	<br>-Support for 1-4 players (all must be using controller though)
	<br>-AI players (however a.o.w they are pretty simple)
	<br>-Free Play mode with two choosable maps
	<br>-The begining of a season mode
	<br>-A Replay system for when goals are scored
	<br>-A MVP system
	<br>-Paint splats
	<br>
	<br>So far the game is very basic in it's art and has no sounds. However expect that sometime later this will change. Just probably not for a while.
	a.o.w. The majority of focus for development is in improving both the AI and season modes.
	<br>
	<br>Anyways, i'm not going to make a large post here. I hope that i stick to this game enough to make something great. I'll update the download link
	once i have a build i deem publishable. Until then, the current download link will have a earlier build, which will require two players (both using controllers)
	to play.
