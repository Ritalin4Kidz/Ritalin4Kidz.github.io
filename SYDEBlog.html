	<br> Welcome To SYDE, a brand new game in development.
	<br> I know this blog seems pretty bare bones at the moment, however as the week goes on I plan to update this page a lot. Not only is this new project open source (which means you can download the source
	code from github and have a play with it), but I'm also going to be updating this page with:
	<br> - Tech Documentation
	<br> - Design Documentation
	<br> - Mock Up Pixel Art
	<br> - Story Design
	<br> - And Much More!
	<br> For the first post though, I'm just going to quickly talk about my plans for this new project and exactly what "SYDE" is. "SYDE" is a short adventure story game (planned gameplay time is approx. 30mins)
	which runs entirely from the windows terminal. The whole project is made entirely in visual studio, with no external engine used. I will show off more details as this game develops. Until then, you can play
	a very unfinished prototype.[
	<br>    Love, from Callum 8/01/2019
