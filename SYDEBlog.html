	<br> Welcome To SYDE, a brand new game in development.
	<br> I know this blog seems pretty bare bones at the moment, however as the week goes on I plan to update this page a lot. Not only is this new project open source (which means you can download the source
	code from github and have a play with it), but I'm also going to be updating this page with:
	<br> - Tech Documentation
	<br> - Design Documentation
	<br> - Mock Up Pixel Art
	<br> - Story Design
	<br> - And Much More!
	<br> For the first post though, I'm just going to quickly talk about my plans for this new project and exactly what "SYDE" is. "SYDE" is a short adventure story game (planned gameplay time is approx. 30mins)
	which runs entirely from the windows terminal. The whole project is made entirely in visual studio, with no external engine used. I will show off more details as this game develops. Until then, you can play
	a very unfinished prototype.

	with the most basic class of the engine.

	<br> The TextItem class can be simply defined as the variable for each pixel in the main window. This variable contains both the text and the colour at that point in the window. There's not much to this class, but to use it is simple:
	<br> - use the getters (getChar, getColour) to return the char and colour respectively
	<br> - use the '=' to set the TextItem to another TextItem
	<br> - initialize with TextItem(text, colour)
	<br> The colour is an int variable, which might seem a bit confusing. However, I will go over it in "ConsoleWindow.h/cpp"

	<br> The Line class is where we finally start to get this window showing. Each line holds a vector of TextItems, which we can print to the screen one by one. Because it's done this way, we can change the console's
	colour output to the one stored in the TextItem everytime we print out a character. This class has no other primary function.

	<br> First off, the ColourClass. Each Colour in the ColourClass is linked to an integer, starting with 0 (BLACK), and incrementing each time. This allows to initialize the colour in a TextItem with a Colour variable.
	The key i've done for ColourClass naming is:
	<br>
	<br> [TEXTCOLOR]_[BGCOLOR]_BG
	<br>
	<br> Except for the initial values, which is the name of the text colour, with a default black background.

	<br> I'll go a bit more in-depth about functionality in future blog updates, but for now here's a quick run-down:
	<br> - Clear Console: Clears the screen, with option to remove all stored text from the window's memory
	<br> - Add Text To Line: Append text to a line
	<br> - Add Layer To Line: Set text on a line, wherever a blank space is set, it won't erase that text from the console
	<br> - Set Line: Change a line in the console
	<br> - Clear Line: Erase a line in the console
	<br> - Set Text At Point : Using A Vector 2, Changes the text & colour at a specific point in the console
	<br> - Get Text Colour At Point : Returns the text colour at a vector 2
	<br> - Set Offset : Set the position offset of the window
	<br> - Get Line : Returns a line
	<br> - Write Console : Prints the window to the terminal

	<br> Example Usage:
	<br> To try this out download the source code from my github, then comment everything from the main function except the generateArt() function (Make sure it's uncommented)

	<br> Inside this class we have the basic setters & getters for the x & y variables. You'll notice that the variables are in float format, however we will be using exclusively whole integers whenever we call this up. This class
	is not actually complicated at all in it's functionality, so i'll just give a quick run-down.
	<br> - Operator+(Vector2 other) - For Vector2 + Vector2 operations (e.g. (2,2) + (1,0) == (3,2))
	<br> - Operator-(Vector2 other) - For Vector2 - Vector2 operations (e.g. (2,2) - (1,0) == (1,2))
	<br> - Operator*(float other) - For Vector2 * Float operations (e.g. (2,2) * 2 == (4,4))
	<br> - Operator=(Vector2 other) - For Vector2 = Vector2 operations (e.g. (VectorA (2,2) = VectorB(4,4), VectorA returns (4,4))
	<br> - Operator==(Vector2 other) - Return true if two Vectors are equivalent to each other.
	<br> - offset(float other) - Return Vector2(Vector2.x + offset, Vector2.y + offset)	
	<br> - distance(Vector2 other) - Return the distance between two points in float format.
	
	<br> - WillHit(Vector2 other, Vector2 gravity) - Returns a variable to see if the Vector2 will go past/touch a certain position when gravity is applied. Used in Rigidbodys.

	<br> Now the rigidbody class might seem scary, until you realise that the majority of the functions here are actually just getters and setters. In fact, there is only one function that we need to have a look at in the
	whole Rigidbody class! That function of course is the Gravity function.

	<div id = "smalltext" style = "font-size:20;color:black;text-align: left">
	<br> This is where the WillHit function from the previous class comes into use. The gravity function is simple to explain. We check to see if two rigidbodies are going to hit, if they are, we reduce the speed so that
	the falling rigidbody does not go through the other rigidbody. If it will not hit anything, then it will continue to fall. We call up the graivty function on a loop in the main gameplay loop.

	<br> In this loop, we compare everything in the rigidbody array with each other, applying gravity onto every rigidbody (Assuming it is not tagged as Kinematic). Of course there are a bunch of variables here in which
	I need to explain the use of. I will come back to this when I talk about GameObjects, as it will be more relevant there.

	<br> First of note, I'm not going to be showing the whole code, as it can get quite repetitive. I reccomend looking through 'Character.cpp' if you want to view the full code. Instead I'll be focusing on one of the

	<br> So what we're doing here is setting the text & text colour at certain points of the console window using 'SetTextAtPoint'. Because this truck will be created from more than one position, we need to create it from a origin
	point that's passed in as a parameter. (The point variable)

	<br> In the cutscene loop, we then add this truck to the window to draw, adding to it's X position in each iteration of the loop. It's really just as simple as that! This concludes our quick summary of the SYDE Engine. I will probably go more in-depth to these features as
	I delve deeper into other gameplay topics. Until then, download the source code and have a play around.

	<br> Now, as this isn't actually too complicated (but long enough that I need to cover it in it's own post), let's go through exactly how we make this image appear. Note: I used "gdiplus.h" for this.

	<br> The only function we will need to worry about here is the get_bmp_as_direct_colour_class_array function. It does use the get_colour_from_rgb function, but all that function does is check to see if the

	<br> So what's happening here is that the function goes through every pixel in the specificied dimensions, and adds the pixel twice to a colour array (twice because pixel width = 1/2pixelheight). We then return that
	array so that we can use it in the CustomAsset Class.

	<br> In a previous post, I mentioned that I would talk about GameObjects, and how Rigidbodies played a part in it. I'm going to do that now, and hopefully I can go in-depth enough so that anyone reading can get an
	understanding of what I'm trying to do here. Couple of things of note before I get into this:
	<br>
	<br> - Some of these may not yet be implemented, and will be planned for future engine updates
	<br> - There is no GameObject class, and the Rigidbody class is used as the GameObject Class
	<br>
	<br> Without further ado, let's get into it!

	<br> isTrap
	</div>
	<div id = "smalltext" style = "font-size:20;color:black;text-align: left">
	<br> The isTrap variable is not going to have much usage in the main SYDE game, as this was used back when the game was in a way earlier prototyping stage (back when the game was originally planned to be
	a 2D platformer, the direction changed a little).
